This will create an optimized build in the `dist/` folder.

## Deployment to Vercel

2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and import your repository

3. Vercel will automatically detect the Vite configuration and deploy your site!

Alternatively, you can use the Vercel CLI:

npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

## Customization

You can easily customize:
- The name in `index.html` (line 24)
- The message content in `index.html` (lines 27-30)
- Colors in `style.css`
- Animation speeds in both CSS and JavaScript files

Enjoy! 🎉
